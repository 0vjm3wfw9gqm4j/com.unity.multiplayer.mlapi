            <p class="lead">The MLAPI is a high level networking library built for the Unity
                game engine to abstract networking concept. This allows developers to focus
                on the game rather than low level protocols and networking frameworks. All this
                is provided <strong>for free</strong> under the permissive <strong>MIT Licence</strong>
                by the MLAPI collaborators. The MLAPI is <strong>open source</strong> with
                <strong>no attached costs or limitations</strong>.
